# Versioning

<br/>

<Callout type="info" title="Unstable Warning">
  We recommend pinning to specific versions in production environments and testing thoroughly before upgrading to newer versions.
</Callout>


`form-data-serializer` follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) to ensure predictable and consistent version releases.

## Semantic Versioning

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when we make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner  
- **PATCH** version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.

## Release History
